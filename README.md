# Smart-Step-Safety-System
The Smart Step Safety System is designed to enhance passenger safety by monitoring bus steps and taking corrective actions to prevent accidents. An FSR (Force Sensitive Resistor) sensor is placed under the steps to detect pressure when a passenger stands on them. Once pressure is detected, the system processes the data using an Arduino and activates a buzzer to alert the passenger to move away. If the passenger continues to stand on the steps after the alert, the motor driver reduces the speed of the bus motor to half, emphasizing safety. The system automatically resets once the pressure on the step is removed, restoring the motor's normal speed. Powered by two 3.7V batteries, this system effectively integrates components such as a DC motor, motor driver, and a cardboard bus model to simulate real-world functionality. This solution is a practical and cost-efficient approach to improving urban transportation safety.
